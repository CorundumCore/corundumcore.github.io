Today is my first birthday since coming out publicly! Things have been going
incredibly well for me recently, and I thought it would be good to reflect on
the past seven months and look at how far I've come.

## Presentation

I am so much more comfortable presenting feminine than I was back in January,
even back in May. I've been shopping in the women's section almost exclusively
since graduating. I've gotten comfortable with eyeliner, foundation, and
lipstick. I got new glasses that are a gorgeous ruby red color, and my hair is
growing longer (though that is taking _much_ longer than I would like).

The changes I've experienced on HRT have all been incredible, but there's still
so much more to change, which will only take time. I've gotten increasingly
more dysphoric over my facial hair; my beard shadow never really goes away, and
my stubble in noticeable by midday rather than evening, ever with the closest
shave. Laser hair removal is a process that I'm actively exploring, but it'll
take around six months to really get to the point that I want there.

I have trouble keeping my voice at a feminine range/resonance for long periods
of time, and I'm not super happy with how it sounds, but it's very good
considering I haven't done any actual voice therapy. I still have issues with
mirroring and dropping my voice when around my boyfriend or other people with
deeper voices, which can be frustrating.

## Support

Almost everyone around me, my friends, family, and other people I interact with
on a regular basis have been incredibly supportive. My family has quickly
adjusted to using my name, or at least an agreed-upon gender neutral nickname
when in the company of people we know might be less accepting. I got my first
girl-themed birthday cards earlier this week and very happily cried for a bit.
I went to a friend's wedding in April, and everyone was so kind.

There were issues with a professor during my last semester, but my classmates
100% had my back and were quick to correct him and make sure I was okay if he
misgendered me. My other professors were all excellent, though, and I really
enjoyed working with them on my research project.

## Career

Let's start with the good news! Earlier this week, I accepted a position with
a company working on a NYSDOT contract, with the offer of a full-time position
available at the end of the contract. I'll be working with technologies I'm
familiar with, in an environment that I have tangential experience with through
my college internships and coursework.

It was a struggle getting to this point, though, and the last few months have
been rough on my mental state. Before my legal name change process was
complete* (which we'll talk about in the next section), it was very difficult
finding job postings that I didn't get immediately rejected for. See, many
companies have you fill out some basic information for a preliminary background
check during the application process. While my legal name was updated in June,
it took until earlier this week for my social security record update
application to be processed. Many of these automated preliminary backgrounds
checks gave me no opportunity to input that my legal name and social security
record did match, so my application would instantly go in the metaphorical
trash can.

If I did manage to get through to an interview, I found that I struggled with
video interviews. During my first one, it was very clear that my interviewers
were not expecting to see someone who looked like me on their screen. While
they were polite, I felt more like a specimen being observed rather than a
candidate being considered. That really threw me off my game, and I struggled
with the technical interview after that. It took a few more interviews to brush
off that bad experience, and it was incredibly frustrating knowing that I was
more capable than my interviews were suggesting, and I felt very held back by
my anxiety.

When I did nail an interview, though, I really nailed it! I got a follow-up
call three hours after my interview with my now employer saying that they gave
the green light to write up an offer for me.

## Legal

As I alluded to in the previous section, my legal name change process is (kind
of) complete! I became (officially) Ruby Sullivan on June 10th, one year to the
day after my best friend's legal name change, as well as my parents'
anniversary. I've gotten my new driver's license, new credit/debit cards, new
health insurance cards, and my name has been updated on most of my bills.
While it will base a few more weeks until my new social security card is in, my
record is being updated, which means I'll be able to get a new passport soon.

## Misc. Good Vibes

I completed my first marathon as staff for Power Up With Pride! We blew our
previous donation record out of the water, from $17K to a new record of $21.5K.
This was due, in part, to a last minute donation incentive for team/staff to
read the entire script of The Bee Movie if we reached a total of $20K raised
for [The Trevor Project][tp].

In other speedrunning-related news, I ran at the [Alternate Platform Day][apd]
marathon, did commentary for my friend [Jaxler][jaxler] for the GDQ Hotfix show
[Never Before Seen][nbs], and will be running WitchWay for
[Speedruns 4 Trans Liberation][sr4tl] at the end of the month.

I've also got some really cool things planned that I'll hopefully be sharing
soon.

Until next time! Take care, be safe, and be you. ❤️
