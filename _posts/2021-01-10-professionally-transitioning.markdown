My name is Ruby Sullivan. My pronouns are she/her & they/them.

As of publishing this post, I've been out publicly for only 10 days.

After a few days of gender euphoria and exhaustion, I realized just how much 
work I had to do in order to transition not only socially, but professionally.
I spent the week leading up to New Year's Day updating my Facebook,
[Twitter][twitter], [Discord][discord], [Twitch][twitch], and other social
media sites, but it wasn't until later that I realized I needed to do the same
with [GitHub][github] and [LinkedIn][linkedin].

## Rebranding vs Starting Over

With my social media, it made sense to change my username, display name,
profile picture, etc., and keep the followings that I have made over the last
few years. With my professional online presence, however, it felt better to
make new accounts and websites, since a lot of those things were previously
tied to my deadname and changing them would be more of a hassle than I cared
to deal with.

It helps that I'm still in college; I don't have many professional ties in
tech spaces that I care about keeping updated with my name and pronouns. I'd
likely have taken the time to call around, update old profiles and references,
doing the song and dance that I know many trans people have done who are older
or further along in their careers than I am.

## Plans for 2021

- [x] Build this new website
- [ ] Create a new Jekyll theme *Corundum* for my site so it looks pretty
- [ ] Use NodeCG to create layouts for my Twitch stream
- [ ] Release the alpha build of my currently unnamed online TCG
- [ ] Start podcast/YouTube channel for covering the Seattle Kraken

### So, I guess that's it.

I'll be using this site to keep myself honest on the projects I'm working on,
as well as having a more long-form outlet for my thoughts as I work on being
more comfortable with myself and being out publicly.
