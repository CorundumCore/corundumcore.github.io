It's been a minute, huh?

## What I've Been Doing

I've been pretty busy, and I haven't really had the opportunity to work on
my personal site. I've been finishing up a pretty complicated project for a
client so that I can transfer maintenance over to them, which is easier said
than done. I'm also finishing up my last semester of college, which means
working on a big research project that I can't talk about yet, but I'm super
excited to share with you when I can.

I also finally set up my [email][email]! I had it listed on the site for a
while now, but I wasn't quite ready to start using it. I'm super happy that I
have a nice professional(ish) email that doesn't have my deadname in it now.

## Updating Your Name / Gender @ College

With the start of the new semester came a BUNCH of different headaches with
getting my name and gender updated. Understandably, the university has to have
your legal name on record for a number of documents. Thankfully, my university
has a lot of flexibility in your displayed/preferred/public name, so you'd
THINK it wouldn't be a hassle to update everything.

First, because I am transitioning towards the end of my college career, I can't
change the username tied to my existing account, which has my deadname's
initial's in it. I figured out a half-fix to this, creating an email alias that
is similar to my official username but with corrected initials. This works for
most school systems. However, almost every 3rd-party app we use is tied to our
official school email, rather than the account, so I've found myself having to
email professors and admin multiple times saying "I'll need you to whitelist
*this* email instead for me to log in," which is annoying.

The next annoyance was getting my name change to actually push to all connected
systems within the university. I was confused as to why random things like our
job connection app and email were still showing my deadname, and eventually
gave up and called the IT desk. Turns out, the changes don't push to all
systems until IT tries to access your student account. This creates the super
fun situation of basically having to call IT and say, "Hey, random person that
might be transphobic, I'm trans, can you please enter the account that shows
**all** my personal information, including my deadname and address, so that I
can hope that no one *else* finds out some of this info?" *So that was fun.*

# Applying While Trans

This segues pretty well into *how* I found out that my name changes didn't get
pushed to all university systems.

I was trying to get a jump on applying for post-graduation jobs, and had sent
out a few applications before I realized there was an issue. Despite the fact
that my resume had the right name, and the application sent through the job
connection portal was using the new email alias, the application still had my
deadname at the top of the form. I tried to change it, but the application was
already sent.

This creates the fun thought experiment of, 'am I not getting calls back because
the names didn't match and they assumed it was an error, or because that outed
me, or am I just not good enough?' And while this whole thing had some things
unique to my situation, I feel like it speaks to a much larger issue trans
people face while applying for jobs.

Since [Trump's Justice Department reversed an Obama-era interpretation of the
Civil Rights Act that prohibited discrimination in the workplace on the basis
of gender identity][civil-rights-act], trans people have been understandably
antsy about being out during the application process for a new job. This is
especially true if they're early in their transition and don't feel like they
'pass', or haven't gone through the legal name change or gender marker change
processes.

I'm undoubtedly inexperienced on this front, since I've only had one Zoom
interview since coming out, am still very masc-presenting, and have not
undergone any of the legal name change or gender marker change process. I have,
however, talked to a lot of my trans friends and other trans people about their
experiences, and there are a lot of issues we all face.

- Assumption of pronouns/title/gender
- Invasive personal questions
- Misgendering
- Previous work/experience under a different name
- Presentation

### What I'm Doing Moving Forward

I am very proud of my trans identity, and I can only see myself becoming more
proud as my transition progresses. I also have the privilege of working in an
industry that is more trans-inclusive than most. Because of this, I've decided
to be very open with being trans during my job search. While I'm still deciding
whether or not to put my pronouns on my resume, I plan on coming out within the
first exchange of messages or interview. While this will probably cause me to
miss out on a decent number of job opportunities, I'd rather work at a place
that I *know* is okay with me being trans than one where I have to either go
back in the closet, or stress out about not passing well enough and getting
outed.

I want to stress that everyone's choice in how to navigate their job search
is valid, and I don't want to give the impression that this is the *perfect*
way to go about it. This is just my choice, for my situation.

So that's it for now. I might be posting again soon about a dumb project idea I
had, but we'll see if I can find the time. Take care, be safe, and be you! ❤️
