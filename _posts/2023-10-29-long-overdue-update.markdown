Not gonna lie, I kinda forgot this blog aspect of my personal website
existed. üòÖ But hello! Want to give some very brief updates to what I've
been up to for the past 2 years.

## Career

Since my last update, I've been working as a software quality
engineer for [Kodak Alaris][ka] for about 2 years. I've had the
privilege to lead 2 separate projects in the time, to varying success.

I don't think I ever pictured myself working in a QA role, but now
that I'm here, I struggle to see myself leaving. I enjoy the cyclical
nature of the workload that allows for a pretty healthy work/life
balance most of the time. It's definitely not for everyone, but I like
the people I work with and the responsibilities I have.

## Streaming and Speedrunning

Unsurprisingly, establishing your career really cuts into your gaming
time and energy. I've streamed only a handful of times, but I do think
I'm ready to start up again. Not with any seriousness, as I have no
intention of treating streaming like a job. It's just a hobby and an
excuse to play video games and hang out with friends I can't see in
person.

Speedrunning has also been on hold a bit, as I haven't really found a
game that really captures my interest in the way that [Fe][fe] and
[Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle][mrkb] did. That being said, the times
for MRKB have gone sub-3:30:00, with the newest world record not using
the power orb duplication glitch that was discovered right before the
release of the sequel, [Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope][mrsoh] (remind
me to make a proper tutorial video on how that works and the potential
benefits for the run).

I did start running a game called [Imp of the Sun][iots], but with no
other runners I don't have much incentive to improve my times. Maybe
I'll submit it to a marathon or two in the future and see what happens.

## Personal

The past two years have been the best of my life, no exaggeration. I've
formed relationships, romantic and otherwise, with some incredible and
kind people in the Western NY region, discovered how much I love
socializing now that I actually love myself, and have been consistently
improving myself with regular therapy (which I think everyone should do).

My goals for the next few years are to persue the more-involved gender
affirming procedures I desire, travel to Japan to visit one of my dearest
and oldest friends who moved there to become an English teacher, and
either host or run at a GDQ mainstage event now that I've made
comfortable progress in my transition.

And that's about all I've got! I hope it won't take longer than two
years for my next update, but who knows. Until then, take care, be safe,
and be you. ‚ù§Ô∏è
