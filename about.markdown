Hi, I'm Ruby Sullivan, and my pronouns are she/her & they/them. I'm a
Computer Science student at the [Rochester Institute of Technology][rit],
entering my final semester.

My current focuses are in web development and broadcast graphics, and I've
worked on projects pertaining to GPS data, CRISP-DM, accessability in
computing, and tech education.

My only remaining graduation requirement is a semester of cooperative
education, which RIT defines as significant, full-time, paid work experience
directly related to a student's field of study. Therefore, hiring me for a
full-time position would complete my graduation requirements and secure a
young, motivated talent for your company!
