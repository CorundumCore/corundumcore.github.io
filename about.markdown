Hi, my name is Ruby Sullivan, and my pronouns are she/they. I am a transgender
software engineer, streamer, and tech educator living in the Greater Rochester
Area of Upstate New York. I am an alumnus of the
[Rochester Institute of Technology][rit] and [Computer Science House][csh].

My current focuses are in web development and broadcast graphics, and I've
worked on projects pertaining to GPS data, CRISP-DM, accessability in
computing, and technology education geared toward younger minds.

I also do a lot of volunteer work, particularly around charity speedrunning
marathons and similar organizations. Currently, I'm a mod for
[SpeedrunsRochester][srroc] and on staff for [Power Up With Pride][puwp].
